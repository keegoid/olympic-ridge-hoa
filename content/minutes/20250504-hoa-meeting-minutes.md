## Summary

### Implementing Clear Signage for Community Safety

The team agreed that posting "Private Property" and "No Trespassing" signs at the community entrance would help prevent damage from construction vehicles and deter unauthorized individuals.

### Sign Placement and Speed Limit Discussion

The team decided to place 10 signs but agreed against posting speed limits, considering it excessive. They also concluded that speed bumps would be too costly.

### Towing Company Partnership for Parking Violations

A board member proposed a partnership with a towing company to manage parking violations in the fire lane. The company would not charge the HOA for towing; the vehicle owner would be responsible for the costs.

### Securing Stormwater Easement with Bollards

The team discussed installing bollards at two locations to prevent unauthorized access, with an estimated cost of $4,500 for six bollards. They planned to seek bids, contact the fire department for lock requirements, and submit a package to Mason County for approval.

### Neighborhood Watch Initiative

The team discussed a neighborhood watch initiative set for May 24th, with the possibility of recording the event for those unable to attend.

### Lawn Maintenance and Management Issues

The board expressed dissatisfaction with the current management company, particularly with the frequency of inspections and the lack of response from their point of contact. The team agreed to contact the management company to clarify expectations. They also considered using a local resident for landscaping services.
