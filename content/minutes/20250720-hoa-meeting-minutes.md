## Summary

### Parking & Signage

The board discussed the "No Parking" signs provided for free by a towing company. One homeowner removed a sign from their property. The board will continue to use the larger, free signs for now, but approved one homeowner's request to purchase their own smaller sign at their own expense.

### Landscaping & ACC Requests

A significant discussion took place regarding homeowners modifying their front yards without submitting an Architectural Change Control (ACC) request. The board is concerned about inconsistent aesthetics. It was decided that homeowners who have already made unapproved changes must submit a retroactive ACC request.

### Community Maintenance & Management Company

Board members expressed frustration with slow communication from the management company. This has caused delays in ordering materials like bollards. The board also noted that the current landscaping contract only covers the community parks, leaving other common areas neglected.

### Loose Dogs & Other Violations

A complaint was filed about a dog repeatedly getting loose from a property on Olympic Ridge Blvd and chasing a resident. Since local animal control is not responsive, the board will have the management company send a formal violation letter. Fines may be levied if the issue continues. The management company will also send violation notices for all other issues from the latest inspection report, including yards with excessive clover, dead trees, and unapproved promotional signs.

### Neighborhood Block Party

The board confirmed the neighborhood block party is scheduled for August 2nd. The fire department will be in attendance. The event will be held in the park, with the possibility of food trucks.
