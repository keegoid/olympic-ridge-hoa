## Summary

### Board Meeting Recap and Budget Review

The meeting began with a recap of the past year's accomplishments, including successful elections, safety improvements, website development, and landscaping updates. A Board member highlighted the progress made in the community and expressed appreciation for resident contributions. The meeting then transitioned to a detailed budget review led by the Treasurer.

### 2026 Budget and HOA Updates

The Board reviewed the 2026 budget, which includes a $5 monthly increase ($60 annually) to cover rising utility and maintenance costs. It was explained that the HOA funds all community expenses, including repairs and snow removal, while maintaining reserves for emergencies. Two outstanding issues were discussed: the storm pond cleanup (scheduled for spring) and Scotch broom removal, which may be added to the landscaping contract as an extra cost. The budget was approved via vote, and the Board announced an upcoming election in April to fill one open seat.

### HOA Pond Liability Discussion

The Board addressed liability concerns regarding the community pond. It was noted that incidents would be covered by HOA insurance, though a homeowner suggested installing "at your own risk" signs to further mitigate risk. Another resident expressed gratitude for the installation of bollards, which have successfully reduced unauthorized traffic and dumping. The Board also clarified that garage sales are permitted as there are no restrictions in the CCRs.

### Fire Lane and Road Safety

The Board explained the enforcement of the community fire lane, which is located on private property. Residents were informed of the process for issuing warnings to vehicles parked in restricted areas. Additionally, a homeowner raised concerns regarding road safety, specifically the need for arterial striping on the entry road to prevent accidents and improve visibility.

### HOA Road Maintenance Responsibilities

The HOA maintains the private road leading to the community but shares responsibility with a neighboring property owner. The Board clarified that maintenance, including snow plowing and potential speed bumps, is funded by the HOA. The Board will review plat maps to confirm exact property boundaries and maintenance obligations.

### HOA Fee Increase Discussion

The annual HOA fee is increasing from $940 to $1,000 for 2026. Because initial invoices were sent out at the previous rate, the Management Company will issue supplemental invoices for the $60 difference. The Board and residents discussed the timing of this change and addressed concerns regarding a strip of property near the pond where trees may be impacting homeowner views.

### Development Plans and Community Projects

The Board discussed an 8-acre parcel near the pond to determine if it should have been included in the development's public open tracks. Plans for a community playground remain in the preliminary stages as a long-term project. Finally, the Board highlighted a new community sign for local events and thanked the volunteer who developed the functional community website.

### HOA Rules and Infrastructure Updates

The Board discussed website guidelines regarding waste management, emphasizing that garbage cans should not block sidewalks. The importance of ACC requests for documenting property alterations was reiterated. Infrastructure updates included the installation of safety bollards on a service road and ongoing mailbox maintenance, which is being completed in phases due to budget considerations.
