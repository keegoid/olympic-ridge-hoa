## Summary

### 2026 Budget and HOA Assessments

The Board reviewed the proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year. Due to administrative timing, assessment letters were previously sent out reflecting 2025 rates. The Board unanimously voted to approve the new budget, which includes necessary dues increases to cover rising operational costs (utilities, insurance, and management fees).

* **Action:** The Management Company will reissue letters reflecting the approved budget and 2026 assessment rates.
* **Discussion:** The Board noted that while the HOA is solvent, careful spending is required in the coming year to ensure reserve contributions meet future projections.

### Financial Management & Reserves

* **Finance Charges:** The Board discussed communication issues regarding the payment portal and finance charges during 2025. A motion was passed to refund all finance charges incurred by homeowners in 2025 as a gesture of goodwill. Moving forward into 2026, finance charges will be strictly enforced now that payment terms are clearly posted on the website.
* **High-Yield Savings:** To maximize the return on the Association's cash assets, the Board voted to move reserve funds into a High-Yield Savings Account. The Board requested the Management Company to present options with the best available interest rates (currently estimated between 3% and 4%).

### Landscaping and Snow Removal

The Board reviewed a competitive bid for landscape maintenance and snow removal.

* **Cost Analysis:** The new bid offers a potential savings of approximately $4,400 annually compared to the current contract.
* **Snow Removal:** Clarification is being sought regarding whether the snow removal quote is a per-event fee or an annual inclusion.
* **Long-term Strategy:** The Board engaged in a significant discussion regarding the high cost of water and irrigation. Proposals were discussed to potentially convert specific grass areas into low-water "parks" or xeriscaped areas in the future to reduce utility burdens. This will be a topic for community input in 2026.

### Parking Enforcement

The Board reviewed recent parking enforcement actions.

* **Violations:** Warning notices (not fines) have been placed on vehicles violating fire lane restrictions and long-term parking rules. Compliance has been high, with most vehicles moving shortly after notification.
* **Specific Incident:** A vehicle leaking fluids on the roadway was addressed. The resident complied by moving the vehicle, and the Board considers the matter resolved.
* **RV Parking Request:** The Board reviewed a hardship request from a resident regarding a recreational vehicle (RV) parked on-site. The Board voted to grant a one-time extension through January 31st, after which the vehicle must be moved.

### Architectural Control Committee (ACC)

* **Retroactive Compliance:** It was noted that several homeowners have installed fences or made exterior modifications (e.g., light fixtures) without submitting the required ACC requests. The Board directed Management to send letters to these homeowners requesting they submit forms to ensure the improvements are properly documented in the Association's files. These are intended for record-keeping rather than denial.
* **New Requests:** The Board approved an ACC request for a trampoline at a residence on Belfair Station, noting the location is secluded and does not impact street aesthetics.

### Community Communication

* **Website:** The Board noted the website is functioning well for reporting issues and general information.
* **Inquiries:** A homeowner requested a copy of their most recent billing statement. The Board directed that this request be handled by the Management Company.
* **Upcoming Meeting:** The next community-wide meeting is confirmed for January 16.
