## Discussion Points

### Financials and ACC Requests

The board agreed to reach out to the property manager for financial updates and discussed assigning one person to respond to ACC requests. They reviewed two requests:

* **Tree Planting**: Approved planting of native vine maple and cascara trees at a specific lot, valued for their ecological benefits and suitability to the Pacific Northwest.
* **Backyard Fence**: Approved a fence at another lot, designed to match neighborhood standards. The board debated contractor legitimacy but concluded it's the homeowner's choice unless issues arise.

### Violations and Parking

Multiple violations were identified, notably at one particular property (four instances, including a trailer and vehicles). The board agreed to confirm with the property manager that violation letters are sent, opting to restart the process fresh with clear notices (possibly in English and Spanish) to avoid confusion.

Fire lane parking issues were discussed, particularly on Northeast Olympic Ridge Lane, where cars on both sides narrow access. The north/east sides are fire lanes (no parking), while the opposite sides are open but not reserved for adjacent homes. The board plans to clarify this at the next community meeting.

### Community Concerns

The board noted inconsistent fire lane signage placement, likely set before full development, but changing them would require significant effort. Enforcement will proceed as-is. Entryway parking risks and drainage issues with Lennar were also addressed, urging residents to document standing water within a year for fixes.

### Meeting Logistics

The board agreed to meet monthly (last Sunday, 2 PM preferred) via Zoom or in-person, using WhatsApp for quick ACC approvals. One board member will record and summarize meetings.

## Next Steps

* **ACC Request Approvals**: A board member will email the property manager to formally approve the two ACC requests discussed.
* **Violation Notices Restart**: The board will restart the violation notice process, confirming with the property manager that letters are sent for all issues, including those at the property with four violations. New first notices will be distributed to affected homeowners.
* **Parking and Fire Lane Enforcement**: The board will enforce parking rules, ensuring cars are removed from fire lane sides of streets. This will be clarified at the next community meeting to prevent disputes.
* **Community Meeting Preparation**: The board will prepare for the next neighborhood meeting to address parking rules and encourage residents to document drainage issues with Lennar before their one-year warranty expires.
* **Lennar Final Inspection**: The board will prepare for Lennar's upcoming final inspection with the county. A board member will send related correspondence to the secretary for review to ensure homeowner interests are represented.
