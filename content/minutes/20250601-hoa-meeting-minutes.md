## Summary

### New Business

A board member reported acquiring a goat to eat Scotch broom, which will be kept at a relative's house and rented out. All recent ACC requests have been approved

### Landscaping and Management Company Issues

A board member raised concerns about the landscaping company's invoicing and lack of communication, noting he had to contact them directly due to non-responsiveness from the property manager. The board also discussed challenges with community-wide communication, exploring options like email lists, Facebook, and a potential HOA website.

### HOA Website Proposal

A board member with a technical background offered to create a static HOA website to handle ACC requests, document storage, and payments. The board also discussed negotiating a reduced rate with the management company if their duties were descoped to focus on enforcement.

### Fire Lane Parking

Concerns were raised about residents parking in fire lanes. Solutions discussed included painting curbs red, installing towing signs, issuing fines, and towing vehicles after warnings. It was suggested that at least two board members should approve any towing action.

### Financial Planning and Rates

A board member stressed the need to review financial documents to plan for long-term goals like road maintenance, which could cost $15-20 million over 50 years. He suggested investing surplus money in index funds. The annual budget if everyone pays is $139,000, and the board is trying to avoid increasing HOA fees. The smaller size of the HOA (144 homes) limits revenue generation compared to other local communities.

### Block Party Planning

The board proposed a block party for August 2nd. A board member will create a Facebook event, and the board plans to invite food trucks.

### Construction Damage and Signage

A board member noted damage to roads from construction trucks. The board plans to install "private property" signs to address this but is still waiting for the signs, which the property manager was supposed to pay for.
