## Summary

### Financial Strategy & Investment

The board reviewed the HOA's finances, noting a current balance of approximately $90,000. A key discussion was the need for a long-term investment strategy to fund major future expenses, like replacing community roads in 50 years. The board agreed to explore setting up a low-cost index fund, starting with an initial investment of $10,000-$20,000. To fund this, a modest annual dues increase was discussed to keep pace with the CPI rate.

### New Development & Traffic Bypass Opportunity

The board discussed the new 100-home development being built to the north. As traffic is a significant issue, the board agreed to explore lobbying the developer to create a second access road connecting Olympic Ridge to the new development. This would function as a bypass, allowing residents to avoid a main traffic bottleneck.

### Community Violations - Loose Dogs

There was an extended discussion about the ongoing issue of loose dogs from one residence chasing residents and creating a safety hazard. The board affirmed the need to send a formal violation letter to the homeowner to create a legal paper trail.

### Landscaping & Maintenance

* **Mailbox Area**: The board decided to solicit quotes to have the unmaintained grass area around the cul-de-sac mailboxes removed and replaced with low-maintenance river rock.
* **HOA Contract**: The board considered a landscaping estimate from a local resident but decided to continue with the current professional provider due to concerns about licensing and bonding.

### Architectural Control Committee (ACC) Requests

Several homeowners have made landscaping improvements without submitting an ACC request. While the board favors the improvements, they stressed the importance of submitting paperwork for liability and record-keeping. A follow-up with the property manager is planned.
