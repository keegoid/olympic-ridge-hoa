## Quick Recap

The Board approved several key initiatives for the upcoming year. A new online financial portal from J&M Management was approved to allow residents to see balances and pay dues online. To cover this and other rising costs, a $5 per house dues increase will take effect January 1, 2026. The Board also formally renewed its contract with J&M Management. The new community website (OlympicRidgeHOA.com) was reviewed, and a plan to begin investing the HOA's reserve fund with a professional advisor was put in motion.

## Next Steps

* **A board member**: Confirm the implementation timeline for the new financial portal with J&M.
* **A board member**: Contact the fire department to ask if a dual-padlock system is acceptable for the new bollards.
* **A board member**: Distribute the finalized meeting agenda and action item list to the board.
* **A board member**: Notify J&M of the approved $5 dues increase, to take effect January 1, 2026.
* **A board member**: Email J&M to request processing of the reimbursement for the HOA website domain fee.
* **A board member**: Research reputable investment firms and relevant laws regarding HOA reserve fund investments.
* **A board member**: Meet with landscaping vendors to get quotes for finishing the landscaping at the Olympic Ridge mailbox cul-de-sac.
* **A board member**: Obtain a quote from a secondary vendor for the mailbox landscaping project.
* **A board member**: Forward the landscape maintenance contract bid from a potential new vendor to the board for review once it is received.
* **A board member**: Inquire with local city contacts to identify vendors and typical costs for playground equipment, for future planning.
* **The HOA Board**: Announce the new HOA website (OlympicRidgeHOA.com) to the community via Facebook, the community board, and postings by the mailboxes.

## Summary

### Agenda and Minutes Format

A new, more formal agenda format was introduced to keep meetings on track and maintain records. Meeting minutes posted to the new website will be sanitized to remove any private or sensitive information before public posting.

### Financial Review

The financial review was presented. The HOA's account balance as of the end of September was reviewed. Monthly expenses are holding steady. There are still outstanding HOA dues pending collection for the year. It was noted that the current check-only payment system may contribute to late payments, a problem the new portal will address.

### Snow Removal Contract

The board discussed snow removal as a major potential expense, citing significant costs from last year. The board agreed the current vendor's service last year was good, with roads cleared early in the morning.

### J&M (GH) Management Portal

A proposal from J&M to provide a new resident portal was introduced. The new HOA website is a static site and cannot handle finances or payments, making this portal necessary. The board unanimously agreed to approve the new portal to fix resident complaints and allow homeowners to see their balances and pay dues online.

### HOA Website (OlympicRidgeHOA.com)

The new HOA website, OlympicRidgeHOA.com, was presented. The only cost is the annual domain name registration, for which a reimbursement has been submitted. The site is secure as it has no logins. It includes dark/light themes, sanitized meeting minutes, an announcements page, a Google Calendar for events, a document library via Google Drive, and a board contact form. The ACC request page was highlighted, noting a trend of residents making changes without approval. The form allows residents to submit requests directly to the board.

### HOA Dues Increase

The board discussed a cost-of-living increase to cover the new J&M portal and general inflation. A $5 per house increase was proposed, which would make the annual due an even $1,000. The board voted to approve the $5 increase, effective January 1, 2026.

### HOA Reserve Fund Investments

The board agreed that J&M will not handle investments, so the board must take action. The need for long-term (50-75 year) planning to fund major infrastructure replacements, such as roads, was emphasized. A standard savings account is not sufficient. The board agreed to hire a professional investment advisor to manage the funds, which provides expertise and offloads liability from the board.

### Community Upgrades

* **Bollards:** The installation is 50% complete.
* **Community Board:** The holes have been dug but need to be made deeper or wider.
* **Landscaping (Olympic Ridge Mailbox):** It was clarified that a payment made last year was only for the rocks immediately around the mailbox structure, not the entire landscaped area. The surrounding area remains patchy mud. The board will get new quotes from two different vendors to finish the project.
* **Playground/Picnic Shelter:** The board discussed adding a playground and/or picnic shelter to the other park area. This is a major expense and will be put on hold until Spring, pending a review of EOY financials.
* **Bus Shelter:** The board discussed building a shelter at the bus stop. Due to liability, this project must be handled by a licensed and bonded contractor.

### Bollard Locks (Fire Dept. Access)

The required fire department padlocks were presented. It was noted that if the HOA only uses these locks, the board will have no key or access. This is a problem if a contractor needs access for maintenance (e.g., a fallen tree). A dual-lock system was proposed. The board will contact the fire department to see if this is an acceptable solution.

### New Landscaping Contractor Bid

The board is reviewing a bid from a potential new landscaping vendor. The company is licensed, bonded, and insured. Their services would include full irrigation maintenance/winterization, seasonal flower planting, and 24/7 storm cleanup as part of the contract. The owner is willing to attend HOA Zoom meetings if needed. The board is waiting on the itemized quote to compare with the current vendor.

### J&M (GH) Management Contract Renewal

The board reviewed the new service agreement from J&M, which includes a cost increase. The board unanimously agreed to sign the renewal, stating that the board does not have the bandwidth to switch management companies at this time.
