## Dangerous Trees

Several dead, broken, or leaning trees were noted throughout the community, requiring specific evaluation. Many hazardous trees are on adjacent Navy land, which will require a slow permission process.

* **North side of the utility service road**: One dead tree, a couple split/broken.
* **Park area (north of Olympic Ridge)**: At least one dead tree identified.
* **Behind homes on Olympic Ridge**: Numerous "Widowmaker" (leaning/falling) and broken trees were noted behind several properties.
* **Cul-de-sac (south side of Olympic Ridge)**: A dead tree was noted just to the left of the mailboxes.
* **East side of Olympic Ridge**: Mentioned as having quite a few trees needing attention.
* **End of Belfair Station Road**: Trees were noted as broken halfway up on potential Navy land.

## Sidewalks

Numerous cracks and chips were identified throughout the community. It was noted that replaced sections might not match the color of existing concrete.

* **Utility service road (south side)**: Chipped.
* **Olympic Ridge**: Multiple chips and cracks were noted near various homes.
* **Belfair Station Road**: Multiple chips and cracks were noted near various homes.
* **Ridge Top Crossing**: A crack was noted at the corner.

## Street Signs & Lighting

The street sign at Olympic Ridge Lane & Olympic Ridge Street is warped and not aligned correctly. A request was made to add a light post across from the mailboxes. Another large gap between lights was noted on the West side of NE Ridgepoint Blvd.

## Other Community Issues

* **Asphalt Damage**: Chemical damage was noted on the asphalt in a cul-de-sac on Ridge Point Boulevard.
* **Improperly Stored Container**: A large, blue metal recycling container is being stored visibly from the street near a home on Olympic Ridge.
* **Property Line Marker Hazard**: A piece of rebar between two properties on Olympic Ridge is sticking up, creating a tripping hazard.
* **Burned Electrical Box**: An electrical/gas pipeline box in front of a home on Olympic Ridge has burn marks.
* **Manhole Covers**: A manhole cover on Belfair Station Road is slightly off-balance and makes noise.
* **Poorly Maintained Common Areas**: An area near the south cul-de-sac mailboxes and a grassy area on Belfair Station Road need cleanup and better landscaping.
