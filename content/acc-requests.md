## Architectural Control Committee (ACC) Requests

Submit an ACC request for all exterior modifications, additions, or changes to your property. They must be reviewed and approved by the HOA Board before any work begins. This process ensures that property improvements are in harmony with the overall community and adhere to the guidelines established in our CC&Rs.

### Why submit an ACC request?

It's in your best interest to submit an ACC request prior to making exterior modifications, additions, or changes to your property. Failure to do so risks fines or possibly having to undo the changes, which nobody wants to have happen.
