2. **Second Notice:** A final warning reminder.
3. **Third Notice:** A **$50.00 fine** is assessed.
4. **Fourth - Sixth Notices:** Fines double with each notice, up to **$400.00**.
5. **Continuing Violations:** An additional $100.00 per month accrues until fixed.

*Note: Fines over $50.00 become a lien against the property.*

### Appeals

If you receive a violation notice you disagree with, you must submit a written appeal to J&M Management within **48 hours** of the notice.
