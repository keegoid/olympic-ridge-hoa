A friendly reminder that the approved fall landscaping project for the community's main entrance is scheduled to begin on Monday, September 15th.

Crews will be on-site from approximately 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Please be mindful of workers and equipment in the area and consider using the alternate entrance if possible to reduce congestion.

We are excited to see this refreshment completed and appreciate your cooperation!
